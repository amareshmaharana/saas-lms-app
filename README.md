## Getting Started 🚦
Prerequisites:
- Node.js LTS and npm (or pnpm/yarn/bun). 
- Git installed.

Steps:
```
Clone and install
git clone <your-repo-url>
cd saas-lms-app
npm install
```

text
```
2) Configure environment
cp .env.example .env.local
```

text
Fill keys as per your enabled providers below.

3) Run dev server
npm run dev

Open http://localhost:3000

---

## Environment Variables 🔐
Create .env.local and add only what you use. Comment others.

App
```
NEXT_PUBLIC_APP_URL=http://localhost:3000
```

Auth (Clerk)
```
NEXT_PUBLIC_CLERK_PUBLISHABLE_KEY=
CLERK_SECRET_KEY=
NEXT_PUBLIC_CLERK_SIGN_IN_URL=/sign-in
NEXT_PUBLIC_CLERK_SIGN_IN_FALLBACK_REDIRECT_URL=/
NEXT_PUBLIC_CLERK_SIGN_UP_FALLBACK_REDIRECT_URL=/
```

Database (Supabase)
```
NEXT_PUBLIC_SUPABASE_URL=
NEXT_PUBLIC_SUPABASE_ANON_KEY=
```

Payments (Stripe)
```
NEXT_PUBLIC_STRIPE_PUBLIC_KEY=
STRIPE_SECRET_KEY=
STRIPE_WEBHOOK_SECRET=
```

Monitoring (optional)
```
SENTRY_AUTH_TOKEN=
```

---

### Clerk + Supabase Integration🔒
```
Map Clerk ⇄ Supabase tokens if you integrate both in Next.js apps.
```

---

## Scripts 🧪
npm run dev # Start Next.js dev server (port 3000)
npm run build # Production build
npm start # Start production server
npm run lint # Lint (if configured)

These align with a standard create‑next‑app baseline and optional extras.

---

## Development Notes 🧭
- App Router: Keep server components for data‑heavy UI and colocate route handlers.
- Auth Guards: Protect server actions and UI with your auth provider.
- Payments: Expose a Stripe webhook route under /app/api/webhooks/stripe and test with CLI.
- DB Access: Prefer server‑side calls; if using Supabase with Clerk, attach Clerk tokens.
- README Quality: Include badges, screenshots, and clear install steps for contributors.

---

## Deployment 🚀
Vercel is recommended for instant Next.js deployments. Connect the repo, set environment variables, and deploy from main.

- Add env keys in Project Settings → Environment Variables.
- Configure Stripe webhooks to your deployed webhook endpoint.
- Use separate keys for preview vs production.

---

## Roadmap 🗺️
- Course creation UI with rich text, sections, and lesson media.
- Student progress, quizzes, certificates, and analytics.
- Catalog search, filters, tags, and recommendations.
- Instructor payouts and revenue reports.
- Teams/organizations and RBAC.

---

## Contributing 🤝
Contributions are welcome:
- Fork, create a feature branch, and commit with context.
- Add tests or screenshots for UI changes where possible.
- Open a PR describing scope, migration notes, and tradeoffs.

## Acknowledgments 🙌
Inspired by established Next.js LMS/SaaS examples that pair Next.js with Supabase, Clerk, and Stripe for a full production workflow. Great for learning, prototyping, and shipping quickly. [web:2]
